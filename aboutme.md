Hi, my name is Raquel Sweet! I am a junior at Cornell University majoring in Mechanical Engineering and minoring in Business. I’m originally from San Francisco, California, and I’m passionate about pursuing a career in aerospace that advances innovation and sustainability. At Cornell, I’ve been involved in hands-on projects like Design Build Fly and the Magnus Ultralight Research Project, where I’ve worked on aircraft design, structural analysis, and prototyping. These experiences have deepened my interest in flight and given me the skills to connect classroom theory with real-world engineering. Beyond academics, I am in a sketch comedy group, and I enjoy traveling. Looking ahead, I hope to combine my technical background with my passion and creativity to make meaningful contributions to the aerospace field.
