    <h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>One of the projects I am working on this year through the Cornell University Design Build Fly(CU-DBF) project team is to design a towable and deployable banner for the team’s aircraft that is 30 inches by 150 inches. I am working to minimize drag while ensuring that the banner can be folded into a small volume as it will need to open during flight. In order to achieve an optimal design I have been leading dynamic testing to validate aerodynamic drag models and optimize design performance. From these tests I have concluded Rips Stock Nylon will produce significantly less drag than Low Density Polyethylene and a stiffener must be used along the leading edge of the banner to increase its rigidity. I am now conducting more dynamic tests to solve three key factors. First I am carefully determining the best material to use for the leading edge that is stiff enough, while simultaneously being foldable and not adding too much weight to the complement. Second, I am working to further determine how to ensure the banner’s proper orientation can be maintained during flight. Lastly, I must determine how to ensure that the banner is not fluttering significantly during flight. Fluttering from a smaller scale mode, with the same aspect ratio of the full scale model increased the expected drag by a ratio of 7.5. Therefore, reducing fluttering effects will be key to my team’s performance at competition. I will be conducting more dynamic testing in the coming weeks to optimize the banner design.</p>
