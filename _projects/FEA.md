### Summary
I have utilized FEA for both my work as the Mechanical and Structural subteam lead on Cornell University Design Build Fly (CUDBF) as well as during my work on the Magnus Ultralight Research Project. One example of using FEA for CUDBF was to model the impact force on the landing gear of the team's aircraft. I presented the images depicted above during the team's critical design reviews and explained that the stress was far below the yield stress of the composite material with a factor of safety of at least 4.5 based on the material profile from Granta. I then expressed my concern over the total deformation of the landing gear and recommended that stiffeners are added to the component to reduce the deformation upon landing.
