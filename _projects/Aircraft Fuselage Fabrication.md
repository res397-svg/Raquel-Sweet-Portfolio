### Summary
In the 2024 -2025 school year I was tasked with designing a fuselage for the Cornell University Design Build Fly(CU-DBF) team. With minimal restrictions from competition rules, I focused on optimizing the structure, shape, and material to enhance weight, cost, drag, and strength. I chose a clamshell design for its durability while conserving weight and space, and utilized a parabolic shape at the front for its low drag coefficient of 0.05. By opting for carbon fiber over traditional materials, I aimed to improve the fuselageâ€™s reliability and sustainability. It was the first year my team constructed the fuselage from carbon fiber. I conducted multiple iterations of fabrication to determine the optimal techniques. I investigated techniques such as using hollow 3D printed mold with appropriate tolerancing considerations and creating a detailed traceable pattern for the carbon fiber fabric to avoid material overlap and wrinkling even with the complex geometry of the design. By the end of the year I had created a comprehensive manufacturing plan for carbon fiber that the team will be utilizing this year for our manufacturing process. Additionally, I was able to reduce the fuselage mass by 65% from the previous year with the carbon fiber model.
