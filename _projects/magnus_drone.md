### Summary
Over the summer I began working on building an ultralight aircraft with a team of two of my classmates, advised at a bi- weekly meeting by our advisor, Professor Mason Peck. Our goal was to develop a human sized ultralight VTOL capable of flying long distances using only the Magnus Effect, in turn increasing aircraft flight efficiency.

We built multiple iterations of an eVTOL quadcopter aircraft. We refined our designs for each component including our wiring system, motor mounts, landing gears and landing gear attachments, and the quadcopterâ€™s central hub. Eventually we successfully flew our aircraft and completed 4 kg of external payload for the duration of ten five-minute hovers. The mechanism for actuating the spheres also went through several iterations. I designed and built and tested a gear-driven hub system for rotating a Magnus Effect sphere at over 1,500 RPM along with a design for a rigid sphere integration. ANSYS and MATLAB aided our design process by verifying limitations and material capabilities. Additionally, I utilized SOLIDWORKS and Fusion 360 to model our designs for both the main body of the aircraft along with the sphere system.

Moving forward we are working to reiterate our design to give it larger load carrying capabilities. We will then move to test the Magnus Effect on our small scale model, and then design a full scale design for human flight.  Towards the end of the year we will be writing a comprehensive report of our findings.
